In the quiet of the morning light,
Where whispers dance and shadows play,
The world begins to stir from night,
As dawn ignites the start of day.

A breeze, a leaf, a soft refrain,
The sun’s embrace, so warm, so bright,
Each moment’s fleeting, yet remains,
A fleeting glimpse of pure delight.

In these simple joys, we find our way,
To cherish life’s serene ballet.
